## Contributing

This project has just begun and we'd love as many contributors as possible. Any todo items will be logged as Github issues, so feel free to grab one. Also feel free to review existing reference architectures for spelling or grammar mistakes, inconsistencies and over-complex descriptions. We also welcome new reference architecture proposals.
